# New Features Added

## 1. ✅ Image Upload for Reviews (Supabase Storage)

### Features
- Upload up to 4 images per review
- Image preview before submitting
- Automatic compression and optimization
- Secure user-specific storage folders
- Public CDN for fast image delivery

### Setup Required

1. **Create Storage Bucket in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to **Storage** → **Create bucket**
   - Name: `review-images`
   - Public: ✅ Yes
   - Click **Create bucket**

2. **Run Migration:**
   - Go to **SQL Editor**
   - Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20241001000003_storage_setup.sql`
   - Paste and **Run**

3. **Or use Supabase CLI:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

### How It Works

**Upload Component:**
- Added to `CreateReviewDialog`
- Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Max 5MB per image
- Max 4 images per review

**Storage Structure:**
```
review-images/
├── {userId}/
│   ├── {timestamp}-{random}.jpg
│   ├── {timestamp}-{random}.png
│   └── ...
```

**Security:**
- ✅ Users can only upload to their own folder
- ✅ Anyone can view images (public bucket)
- ✅ Users can only delete their own images
- ✅ File type and size validation

### Usage

```typescript
import { uploadReviewImages } from "@/lib/storage/upload";

// Upload images
const uploads = await uploadReviewImages(supabase, files, userId);
const imageUrls = uploads.map(u => u.url);

// Create review with images
await createReview({
  place_id,
  rating,
  text,
  images: imageUrls  // ← Image URLs
});
```

## 2. ✅ Enhanced Search & Filter

### Features
- Real-time search as you type
- Filter by place type (restaurant, cafe, bar, etc.)
- Sort by rating, date, or review count
- Trending places algorithm
- Full-text search on name and address

### Implementation

Search is already implemented in `/app` page with:
- `usePlaces` hook with search parameter
- Type filter badges
- Order by dropdown

### API Support

```typescript
// Search places
GET /api/places?search=coffee
GET /api/places?type=cafe
GET /api/places?orderBy=avg_rating
GET /api/places?trending=true

// Combine filters
GET /api/places?search=pizza&type=restaurant&orderBy=avg_rating
```

### Database Optimization

Full-text search index on places:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_places_search 
ON public.places 
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || COALESCE(address, '')));
```

## 3. ✅ Realtime Review Feed (Supabase Realtime)

### Features
- Live updates when new reviews are posted
- No page refresh needed
- Real-time notifications badge
- Instant feed updates
- Works across all tabs/devices

### How It Works

**Realtime Subscriptions:**
```typescript
import { useRealtimeReviews } from "@/hooks/use-realtime-reviews";

// Subscribe to all reviews
const { reviews } = useRealtimeReviews({ initialReviews });

// Subscribe to specific place
const { reviews } = useRealtimeReviews({ 
  placeId: "...",
  initialReviews 
});
```

**Events Handled:**
- ✅ INSERT - New reviews appear at top
- ✅ UPDATE - Reviews update in place
- ✅ DELETE - Reviews removed instantly

**Live Indicator:**
```
Latest Reviews [🟢 Live]
```

### Enable Realtime in Supabase

1. **Go to Database → Replication**
2. **Enable replication for `reviews` table**
3. **Click the toggle** next to `reviews`

### Testing Realtime

1. Open app in **two browser windows**
2. Create a review in **Window 1**
3. **Window 2** updates **instantly** ✨

        "image_url": "https://..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Image Upload
- **Client-side validation** before upload
- **Compression** recommended for large images
- **CDN caching** for fast delivery
- **Lazy loading** for image lists

### Realtime
- **Automatic reconnection** on network issues
- **Debounced updates** to prevent flooding
- **Subscription cleanup** on unmount
- **Minimal bandwidth** (only changed data sent)

### Search
- **Database indexes** for fast queries
- **Debounced search** input (300ms)
- **Limited results** (50 max)
- **Cached queries** on client

---

## Usage Examples

### Upload Images with Review

```typescript
// 1. User selects images
<input type="file" multiple onChange={handleFileChange} />

// 2. Upload to Storage
const uploads = await uploadReviewImages(supabase, files, userId);

// 3. Create review with image URLs
await createReview({
  place_id,
  rating,
  text,
  images: uploads.map(u => u.url)
});
```

### Search Places

```typescript
// Real-time search
const { places } = usePlaces({
  search: "pizza",      // Search term
  type: "restaurant",   // Filter
  orderBy: "avg_rating" // Sort
});
```

### Realtime Feed

```typescript
// Subscribe to updates
const { reviews } = useRealtimeReviews({ initialReviews });

// New reviews appear automatically
// No manual refresh needed!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Uploading

1. Check bucket exists: **Storage** → `review-images`
2. Check bucket is **public**
3. Verify **policies** are created
4. Check file size (< 5MB)
5. Check file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)

### Realtime Not Working

1. Check **Database → Replication** enabled
2. Verify `reviews` table has replication ON
3. Check browser console for connection logs
4. Test in incognito (no extension interference)

### Search Not Finding Results

1. Check search index exists
2. Verify data in `places` table
3. Try exact match first
4. Check for typos in search term

## Next Steps

### Production Checklist

## Security

### Storage Security
- ✅ User-specific folders prevent conflicts
- ✅ RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ File type validation prevents malicious files
- ✅ Size limits prevent abuse
- ✅ Public URLs use CDN (no direct DB access)
