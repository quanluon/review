# Middleware Fix - Public Access

## Problem

Middleware was redirecting all unauthenticated users from `/app` routes to `/login`.

## Solution

Removed the auth check from middleware to allow public access.

### Before (Lines 41-45)

```typescript
// ❌ This blocked unauthenticated users
if (!user && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/app")) {
  const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
  url.pathname = "/login";
  return NextResponse.redirect(url);
}
```

### After

```typescript
// ✅ Allow public access
// Get user session (but don't block - allow public access)
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();

// Note: Removed auth check - /app routes are now public
// Only API routes with POST/PATCH/DELETE require authentication
```

## Testing

1. **Open incognito window**
2. **Visit** http://localhost:3001/app
3. **Should work now!** ✅ No redirect to login

## What the Middleware Still Does

The middleware still:
- ✅ Refreshes auth sessions
- ✅ Manages Supabase cookies
- ✅ Keeps authenticated users logged in

It just no longer blocks unauthenticated users from viewing content.

## Security

Auth is still enforced where it matters:
- ✅ API routes (POST/PATCH/DELETE)
- ✅ UI dialogs (redirect to login when creating)
- ✅ RLS policies in database

Public read access is intentional and follows best practices.
